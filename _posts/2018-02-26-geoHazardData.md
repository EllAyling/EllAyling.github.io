I was contracted by the University of Portsmouth's [School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/organisational-structure/our-academic-structure/faculty-of-science-and-health/school-of-the-environment-geography-and-geosciences), to create a prototype for the [3DTeLC](https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-projects/3dtelc) project- a three year Erasmus+ funded project for visualisation of geo-hazard data, meant for use within classrooms. The project consisted of converting large digital terrain data, into a usable and textured environment within the Unity game engine. This landscape could then be explored within VR.

The project involved considering VR related problems, such as scale, resolution, and the user experience.

The project has sinced been completed and can be found [here](https://www.3dtelc.com/resources-downloads/husavik-flatey).
