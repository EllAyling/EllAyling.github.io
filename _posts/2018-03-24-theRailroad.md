Feeling inspired by the [Neon challenge](https://connect.unity.com/challenges/neon) and its submissions, as well as sci-fi and cyberpunk in general, I thought I'd give some environment design a go. Having no real experience on the art side of things, I relied entirely on the asset store for all my models, materials, and various other bits and bobs. I created this scene in my spare time over around a month.
